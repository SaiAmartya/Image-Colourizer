# CNN Image-Colourizer
This is the repository of an autoencoder model that converts black-and-white images to colour.

The training and testing dataset used is the [Image-Colourization-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayush9753/image-colorization-dataset).

## Requirements
Here is the requirements document for the colourizer: [Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17pzGwoIqIhhMRrc7eZbiCiMEfnEUco78iabRo-hJ5ho/edit?usp=sharing)

Important libraries needed include:
- Matplotlib
- Pytorch
- Torchvision
- Scikit-Image

## Learning Resources
Most of my learning process and resources used are linked in this repository: [LearningPytorch](https://github.com/SaiAmartya/LearningPytorch)
