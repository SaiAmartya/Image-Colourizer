# CNN Image-Colourizer
This is the repository of an autoencoder model that converts black-and-white images to colour.

# General Info
You can upload or select black and white images for the AI to colourize. The images will be resized to 400x400 before being displayed. 

## Setup
Ensure you are running **Python3.11** for library compatibility. 

Install required libraries and dependencies using

`pip install -r requirements.txt`

Run the Image Colourizer using

`python main.py`

## Dataset
The training and testing dataset used is the [Image-Colourization-Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/aayush9753/image-colorization-dataset).

This kaggle dataset must be stored in a "data" directory with the main programs.

## Program Requirements
Here is the program requirements document for the colourizer: [Requirements](https://docs.google.com/document/d/17pzGwoIqIhhMRrc7eZbiCiMEfnEUco78iabRo-hJ5ho/edit?usp=sharing)
